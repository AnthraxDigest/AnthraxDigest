- 🌱 I’m currently learning ethical hacking, advanced hacking, blockchain, CSS, elm, HTML, Ruby, Python, and Rust. (I know, it's an aweful lot to try and chew at one time. I have managed to get my ethical and advanced hacking certs though.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on well honestly I'm so new to the world of computers I don't know what to even think to collab on. I know that I am interested in creating a new programming language and a few android apps. Along with new ethical hacking tools to help in the workfeild of cyber security. but with my little knowledge of programing I figutre this may be a difficult task for me.
